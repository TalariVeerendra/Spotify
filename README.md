This project is a Spotify-like React application featuring a modern, responsive UI and a custom backend with internal storage for managing user data, playlists, and music metadata. The frontend is built using React, offering a smooth and dynamic user experience with components for browsing tracks, managing playlists, and controlling playback.

The backend is implemented with a lightweight internal storage system (such as a local database, JSON storage, or in-memory store), enabling reliable data handling without relying on external databases. It provides secure API endpoints for authentication, playlist management, and track retrieval.

Overall, this project demonstrates how to build a full-stack music streaming interface by integrating a polished React UI with a simple yet scalable backend architecture.
